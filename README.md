# Assignment_07
Welcome to the repository for my submission for Module 7 of IT FDN 100B, Winter 2020.

Included files are:
1. CDInventory.py

    The Python script for this week's assignment, which has been expanded from last week's submission to include pickling and structured error handling.


2. CDInventory.txt

    A sample CD Inventory that has been pickled and saved to an external file. After verifying the initial load functionality, use:
    
        rm CDInventory.txt

    to test the structured error handling if CDInventory.txt does not exist.

3. Assignment07_Documentation.docx

    The accompanying documentation for this assignment.
